# PSES Conversational Analytics Chatbot

Prototype Streamlit application for conversational analytics on the Public Service Employee Survey (PSES).

Users will be able to ask natural-language questions (e.g., "How has work satisfaction changed since 2019 for CRA?") and receive:
- A precise, data-grounded answer
- A supporting table with the data used
- A short narrative summary
- Clarifying questions only when needed

This repository currently contains the basic application skeleton. Core data, metadata, and conversational logic will be added incrementally.
